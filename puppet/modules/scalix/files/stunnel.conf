; Sample stunnel configuration file by Michal Trojnara 2002-2006
; Modified by Paul Gear 2010 to provide SSL configuration for Scalix

; Some options used here may not be adequate for your particular configuration
; Please make sure you understand them (especially the effect of chroot jail)

; Certificate/key is needed in server mode and optional in client mode

cert = /etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem
key = /etc/stunnel/stunnel.key

; Some security enhancements for UNIX systems - comment them out on Win32
chroot = /var/run/stunnel/
setuid = nobody
setgid = nobody
; PID is created inside chroot jail
pid = /stunnel.pid

; Some performance tunings
socket = l:TCP_NODELAY=1
socket = r:TCP_NODELAY=1
;compression = rle

; Workaround for Eudora bug
;options = DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS

; Authentication stuff
;verify = 2
; Don't forget to c_rehash CApath
; CApath is located inside chroot jail
;CApath = /certs
; It's often easier to use CAfile
;CAfile = /etc/stunnel/certs.pem
;CAfile = /usr/share/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
; Don't forget to c_rehash CRLpath
; CRLpath is located inside chroot jail
;CRLpath = /crls
; Alternatively you can use CRLfile
;CRLfile = /etc/stunnel/crls.pem

; Some debugging stuff useful for troubleshooting
debug = 6
;output = /var/run/stunnel/stunnel.log

; Use it for client mode
;client = yes

; Service-level configuration
